A production-ready cloud storage platform API built with ASP.NET Core, featuring secure file management, team collaboration, and intelligent storage tracking.

[College term paper]

## üöÄ Overview

CloudCore is a comprehensive backend system for cloud file storage and collaboration, similar to Google Drive or Dropbox. It provides RESTful APIs for file/folder operations, team workspaces (teamspaces), user authentication, and storage quota management.

## üéØ Key Features

### File Management
- **CRUD Operations**: Upload, download, rename, move, and delete files/folders
- **Bulk Operations**: Download multiple items as ZIP archives
- **Soft Delete**: Trash system with 30-day retention policy
- **Search**: Query items by name with pagination and sorting
- **Path Management**: Hierarchical folder structure with breadcrumb navigation

### Team Collaboration
- **Teamspaces**: Shared workspaces with separate storage pools
- **Permission System**: Granular access control (read/write/admin)
- **Member Management**: Invite users, manage roles, and track invitations
- **Collaborative Storage**: Independent storage quotas per teamspace

### Storage Management
- **Quota Tracking**: Real-time storage usage monitoring
- **Subscription Tiers**: Free, Premium, and Enterprise plans with different limits
- **Storage Calculation**: Efficient recursive folder size computation
- **Automatic Updates**: Storage usage updated on file operations

### Security
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Authorization Filter**: Automatic user validation on all endpoints
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Prevents unauthorized file system access
- **User Isolation**: Strict enforcement of user-owned resources

## üß© Core Components

### Controllers Layer
Handles HTTP requests and responses, delegates business logic to services:

- **`AuthController`**: User registration and login
- **`ItemController`**: Personal file/folder operations  
- **`TeamspaceController`**: Teamspace management and member operations
- **`TeamspaceItemController`**: File operations within teamspaces
- **`StorageController`**: Storage usage and quota information

### Service Layer
Implements business logic with single-responsibility interfaces:

#### Application Services (Orchestration)
- **`IItemApplication`**: Orchestrates file operations with validation
- **`ITeamspaceApplication`**: Coordinates teamspace item workflows

#### Domain Services (Business Logic)
- **`IItemManagerService`**: Prepares entities for operations (rename, move, delete)
- **`IValidationService`**: Validates names, files, permissions, and business rules
- **`ITeamspaceService`**: Core teamspace and membership logic
- **`IStorageTrackingService`**: Manages storage quota updates

#### Infrastructure Services
- **`IItemStorageService`**: Physical file system operations
- **`IZipArchiveService`**: ZIP archive creation for downloads
- **`IAuthService`**: Authentication and JWT generation
- **`ITrashCleanupService`**: Background job for expired item deletion

#### Data Access
- **`IItemRepository`**: Database queries with async enumerable support
- **`ISubscriptionService`**: User plan limits and restrictions

### Domain Models

**Core Entities:**
- `User`: Authentication and subscription information
- `Item`: Files and folders with hierarchical relationships
- `Teamspace`: Shared workspaces with storage limits
- `TeamspaceMember`: User roles within teamspaces

**Key Relationships:**
- Self-referencing hierarchy for folders
- User ownership of items
- Teamspace membership with permissions
- Soft delete tracking with timestamps

- Supports cross-origin requests


Global Error Handler:

- Catches all exceptions
- Returns user-friendly error messages
- Logs detailed error information



üìà Performance Optimizations

- Async Streams: Memory-efficient processing of large datasets
- Batch Operations: Bulk database updates with configurable batch sizes (500 default)
- Read Optimization: AsNoTracking() for read-only queries
- Natural Sorting: Efficient file name sorting with NaturalSort.Extension
- Pagination: Prevents loading excessive data in list endpoints
- Transaction Batching: Groups multiple operations for atomic commits
- Lazy Loading: Hierarchical queries load data on-demand
- Connection Pooling: DbContextFactory for efficient connection reuse
